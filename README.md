# Smart Poultry Farming System

A modern solution for managing poultry farms with real-time monitoring and automated control systems.

## Overview

This project is a comprehensive poultry farm management system that helps farmers monitor and control their poultry operations. It includes features for tracking bird health, managing environmental conditions, and monitoring feed consumption.

## Features

- Bird health monitoring and tracking
- Environmental control (temperature, humidity, ventilation)
- Feed management system
- Real-time data collection and analysis
- Automated alerts and notifications

## System Architecture

The system is built using a microservices architecture with the following components:

- Backend Service: Main application server
- Environment Service: Monitors and controls environmental conditions
- Health Service: Tracks bird health metrics

All services are containerized using Docker and can be deployed using Kubernetes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Docker
- Kubernetes cluster (for production deployment)
- npm or yarn package manager

### Local Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd poultry-farming-system
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the database:
   ```bash
   npm run setup-db
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Docker Setup

1. Build and run using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

This will start all required services in containers.

## Testing

Run the test suite:
```bash
npm test
```

## Deployment

### Using Kubernetes

1. Apply the Kubernetes configurations:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f k8s/backend-deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f k8s/microservice-deployment.yaml
   kubectl apply -f k8s/nginx-ingress.yaml
   ```

### CI/CD Pipeline

The project uses Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment:

1. Automated testing
2. Docker image building
3. Image pushing to registry
4. Kubernetes deployment

The pipeline configuration can be found in `jenkins/Jenkinsfile`.
